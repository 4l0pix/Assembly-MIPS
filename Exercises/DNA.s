#Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.
#If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred. This is known #as the "Hamming Distance".
#Example:
#We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T. Two strands might look like this->
#GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
#CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
#^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
#They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.
#NOTE:Supose the sequaneces have equal lengths
